# Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement

The task was to enhance the OpenKJ Next Singer Display application with the following requirements:

1. **Improve the settings dialog**: Make it nicely formatted, organized, and polished
2. **Background customization**: Allow users to set background color/image, gradients, etc.
3. **Font customization**: Allow users to set font, font face, and sizes for each entity on the screen
4. **Reset to default**: Implement a button to revert all settings to defaults
5. **Singer change overlay**: Show an overlay when the current singer changes displaying "The next performer is" with the singer name

## Solution Overview

All requirements have been successfully implemented with a professional, polished user interface.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced Settings Dialog ✓

**Before**: Single-screen form with all settings mixed together
**After**: Professional tabbed interface with 4 organized sections

The settings dialog now features:
- **Tab 1 - General Settings**: Basic configuration options grouped logically
  - Rotation Title and Venue Name
  - Number of up next singers
  - Refresh interval
  - Accepting requests toggle
  - Database location with auto-detect
  - Logo selection

- **Tab 2 - Background Settings**: Complete background customization
  - Three background types: Solid Color, Image, Gradient
  - Color picker for solid backgrounds
  - File browser for images
  - Gradient with start/end colors and direction (vertical, horizontal, diagonal)
  - Live preview of selected colors

- **Tab 3 - Font Settings**: Individual font customization for each text element
  - Six customizable elements (Display Title, Venue Name, Current Singer, Current Song, Up Next Singer, Up Next Song)
  - Font family selection from system fonts
  - Font size (8-144px range)
  - Bold and italic styling options
  - Organized in groups for easy navigation

- **Tab 4 - Singer Change Overlay**: Configuration for the new notification feature
  - Enable/disable toggle
  - Duration setting (5-60 seconds)
  - Clear description of feature functionality

### 2. Background Customization ✓

Implemented three background types:

**Solid Color**:
- Color picker dialog for easy selection
- Live preview of selected color
- Default: #161619 (dark gray)

**Image**:
- File browser for image selection
- Supports PNG, JPG, JPEG, BMP, GIF
- Image is centered and scaled appropriately
- Falls back to solid color if image not found

**Gradient**:
- Two color pickers for start and end colors
- Three direction options:
  - Vertical (top to bottom)
  - Horizontal (left to right)
  - Diagonal (top-left to bottom-right)
- Smooth color transitions using QLinearGradient

### 3. Font Customization ✓

Implemented comprehensive font customization for 6 text elements:

| Element | Default Font | Default Size | Default Style |
|---------|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| Display Title | Arial | 48px | Bold |
| Venue Name | Arial | 32px | Bold |
| Current Singer Name | Arial | 38px | Normal |
| Current Song | Arial | 24px | Normal |
| Up Next Singer Name | Arial | 30px | Bold |
| Up Next Song | Arial | 20px | Italic |

Each element can be customized independently with:
- Font family (from all installed system fonts via QFontComboBox)
- Font size (8-144px via QSpinBox)
- Bold checkbox
- Italic checkbox

Font settings are applied dynamically via generated stylesheets.

### 4. Reset to Default Button ✓

Implemented a "Reset to Default" button that:
- Shows a confirmation dialog before resetting
- Restores all settings to DEFAULT_CONFIG values
- Preserves the database path (doesn't reset the DB location)
- Updates all UI widgets to reflect default values
- Provides user feedback via success message
- Located prominently in the settings dialog

### 5. Singer Change Overlay ✓

Implemented a full-screen overlay notification system:

**Detection**:
- Tracks previous singer ID
- Detects when current singer changes
- Only triggers when overlay_enabled is True

**Display**:
- Full-screen semi-transparent dark overlay (rgba(0, 0, 0, 190))
- Large white text (72px)
- Three-line layout:
  1. "The next performer is" (centered, standard size)
  2. Singer name (centered, slightly larger)
  3. "Performing" + song info (centered)

**Behavior**:
- Automatically appears when singer changes
- Displays for configurable duration (default 20 seconds)
- Automatically hides and returns to normal display
- Can be disabled in settings

### 6. Dynamic Style Application

Created an `apply_styles()` method that:
- Generates CSS stylesheets dynamically based on configuration
- Handles all three background types
- Applies individual font settings to each element
- Updates immediately when config changes
- Maintains consistent styling across the application

### 7. Configuration Persistence

Enhanced the configuration system:
- All new settings stored in config.json.bak
- Deep merge for nested configurations (font settings)
- Backward compatible with old config files
- Proper defaults for missing keys
- Error handling for corrupted configs

## Technical Implementation

### Code Structure
- **ConfigWindow**: 500+ lines of organized tab-based UI
  - Modular tab creation methods
  - Clean separation of concerns
  - Proper event handling

- **DisplayWindow**: Enhanced with dynamic styling
  - apply_styles() method for CSS generation
  - show_singer_change_overlay() for notifications
  - Singer change tracking

### Key Technologies
- PyQt6 for GUI (QTabWidget, QFontComboBox, QColorDialog, etc.)
- JSON for configuration storage
- SQLite for database queries
- CSS-like stylesheets for dynamic styling

### Quality Assurance
- Comprehensive testing with multiple configurations
- Backward compatibility verified
- Error handling for edge cases
- Professional screenshots documenting all features

## Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation:

1. **USER_GUIDE.md**: 200+ line guide for end users
   - How to use each tab
   - Tips and best practices
   - Troubleshooting section
   - Default values reference

2. **screenshots/README.md**: Visual documentation
   - Screenshots of all 4 tabs
   - Screenshots of different display configurations
   - Explanation of each feature

3. **Code comments**: Inline documentation of complex logic

## Testing Results
